## 🚀 What I'm About

I'm an undergrad trying to explore different aspects of tech, AI, and ML through research and real-world projects. My goal? To build something meaningful that actually helps people.

**I like working on real-world AI systems where code actually ships, breaks, and gets fixed — not just notebooks.**

Currently, I'm diving deep into:
- 🧠 **Multimodal AI** for medical applications (stroke outcome prediction @ University of Waterloo)
- 📚 **RAG pipelines** for mechanical engineering knowledge bases (@ noCnX)
- 🌐 **Multilingual NLP** and toxicity detection for Indic languages
- 🎓 **AI-powered education tools** that make learning more accessible

---

## 💼 What I'm Working On Right Now

### 🏥 Research Intern @ University of Waterloo *(June 2025 - Present)*
Working with **Dr. Sirisha Rambhatla** on predicting stroke outcomes using multimodal AI
- Combining MRI/CT imaging with clinical data for 3-month mRS prediction
- Building ML ensemble models and medical image segmentation pipelines
- Making AI work for healthcare where it actually matters

### 🏭 ML Project Lead @ noCnX *(July 2025 - Present)*
Leading development of a full-stack RAG pipeline for mechanical engineering
- Helping factory-floor workers get instant answers from technical documents
- Building document ingestion, embedding, and retrieval systems
- Making knowledge accessible to people who need it most

### 📝 Co-authored Research @ IIT Gandhinagar *(Feb 2025 - Apr 2025)*
Created the first large-scale Punjabi toxicity dataset (39k+ annotated comments) with **Dr. Mayank Singh**
- Built toxicity detection models for 7+ Indic languages
- Achieved 80.29% accuracy on Punjabi text classification
- Co-authored **UNITYAI-GUARD** (submitted to EMNLP 2025)

## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🎓 [LearnWise](https://github.com/roh8exe/learnwise) - AI-Powered Learning Assistant
*Because lecture videos shouldn't be painful to review*

Built an intelligent platform that transforms lectures into structured notes and interactive Q&A
- Custom RAG pipeline with Whisper for transcription + FAISS semantic search
- Real-time summarization, multilingual speech-to-text, personalized Q&A
- Modular agents for quiz generation and concept explanation

**Tech:** Python, React, FastAPI, Whisper, FAISS, LangChain, Hugging Face

---

### 👁️ [Real-Time Object Detection App](https://github.com/roh8exe/object-detection-flutter) - Accessibility Focused
*Making the world more accessible, one detection at a time*

Flutter app with real-time object detection and text-to-speech for visually impaired users
- Integrated Google ML Kit + MobileNetV3 (trained on 10M+ images)
- Audible announcements for detected objects
- Actually tested with users to make sure it works

**Tech:** Flutter, Dart, Google ML Kit, MobileNetV3

---

### 👮 [CopBot & CopHelp](https://github.com/roh8exe/police-station-assistant) - AI for Public Services
*Runner-up @ Goa Police Hackathon 2024*

Voice-activated bilingual system for police stations (because not everyone speaks English)
- COPBOT: Incident classification and case filing guidance
- COPHELP: FAQ-based legal query answering
- Custom legal dataset mapping real-world scenarios to case procedures
- Deployed Flask API with case tracking and real-time workflows

**Tech:** Python, Hugging Face, Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## 🧰 Tech Stack

```python
languages = ["Python", "C++", "Java", "JavaScript", "Dart", "SQL"]
frameworks = ["React", "Node.js", "FastAPI", "Flask", "Flutter"]
ml_tools = ["TensorFlow", "PyTorch", "Scikit-learn", "Hugging Face", "LangChain"]
data_science = ["Pandas", "NumPy", "Matplotlib"]
tools = ["Git", "Docker", "VS Code", "Android Studio"]
```

**What I'm learning:** Advanced RAG architectures, medical image segmentation, and how to make ML models that don't just work in Colab

---

## 🎯 Why I Build What I Build

Most of my projects come from seeing real problems:
- **LearnWise** → Struggling to review 2-hour lectures before exams
- **Object Detection App** → Meeting someone who couldn't navigate independently
- **CopBot** → Watching people struggle with legal procedures at police stations
- **RAG for Mechanical Engineering** → Factory workers needing instant access to technical docs

I believe the best tech is the tech that makes someone's day a little easier.
